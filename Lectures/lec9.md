# Lecture 9

**Topics we covered**

- we completed the example studied in the previous lecture to compute attributes for the label counter.

- another example for generating a counter for the temp variables was used.

- temp variables are different than labels as temp variables can be reused in some situations.

- this is shown when writing semantic rules for the production rule for the non-terminal `cond`.

- emphasize that the semantic of the attributes is really important to understand because the semantic rule can be different for different attributes and for different production rules. Some cases we add `+1` and some other cases we add `+2` and some cases we do not add anything, sometime, inherited attribute is enough, and sometimes synthesized and inherited are required. All these are important to understand.
