# Assignment 3


The first two assignments are due next week and you need to submit before the lecture starts.

1. Solve Exercises 2, 5,  10 in Section 1.2 (pages 17-18).

1. Consider the following grammar with 8 production rules, where $R$ is a nonterminal and $a, b, c$ are terminals.

    $R = R$ &amp; $R | R ⊕ R | R ⊗ R | R^∗ | (R) | a | b | c $

    - Prove that the grammar is ambiguous?
    - Devise another equivalent grammar but unambiguous.
