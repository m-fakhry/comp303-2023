# Assignment 1

1. Read Sections 1.1, 1.2, 1.3

2. **Graph coloring language**: Let us represent any undirected graph with a string of tuples where each tuple has the format (_id_, _color_) or (_id1, id2_). The tuple (_id1_, _id2_) indicates that there is an edge between node _id1_ and node _id2_. The tuple (_id_, _color_) indicates the color of the node id.

    - **Example**: The string _“(1,2),(1,red),(3,2),(2,green),(3,yellow)”_ represents a graph with three nodes 1,2 and 3. There are two edges, one between node 1 and node 2, and one between node 3 and node 2. Node 1 is colored red, node 2 is colored green, and node 3 is colored yellow.

    - Write a grammar to accept such graph coloring language. Node id is a number (any sequence of digits) and color can only take on values: red, green, blue, white, and yellow.

    - Write the grammar in ANTLR and generate the parse tree. Validate the grammar using different strings.

3. Write a C++ program that

    - reads a text file that has a string as in question 2

    - outputs the list of nodes in the graph

    - outputs all colors used in the graph
