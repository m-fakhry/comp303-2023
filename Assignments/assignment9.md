# Assignment 9

You do not need to submit the assignment

- Write the complete annotated tree for the following sentence. To do that, you need to
  - write the attribute grammar for the following statements
    - if statement,
    - assignment,
    - for loop statement,
    - cond,
    - expression.
  - write the semantic rules to generate the machine code, especially for the attributes `target`, `ILcounter`, `SLcounter`, `Temp`, and any other attribute that you need to define.
  - Draw the tree with the attributes and their values. When computing the attribute values, use the semantic rules you wrote to make sure they are correct.  

  ```
  int x=5, y=2, z=3;
  if (x+y > 3*k)
    {
      for(int i=0; i<10; i++)
        z += 4 * x + y
    }
  ```
